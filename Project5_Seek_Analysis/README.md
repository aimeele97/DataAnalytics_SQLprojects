### ‚öôÔ∏è Getting the Data

#### Step 1: Data Cleaning
- Uploaded cleaned CSV to **Snowflake**
- Checked and removed duplicate record
- Rename the column

#### Step 2: Data Modeling
- Used SQL to create fact and dimension table to model the data

Source code example:
```sql
  -- ========== 1. DIM_ADVERTISER ==========
  CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE SEEK_DATA.PUBLIC.DIM_ADVERTISER (
      advertiser_id STRING PRIMARY KEY,
      advertiser_name STRING,
      advertiser_logo_url	STRING
  );

  INSERT INTO SEEK_DATA.PUBLIC.DIM_ADVERTISER (advertiser_id, 
       advertiser_name, advertiser_logo_url)
  SELECT DISTINCT advertiser_id, advertiser_name, advertiser_logo_url
  FROM SEEK_DATA.PUBLIC.SEEK_RAW_DATA
  WHERE advertiser_id IS NOT NULL;
```

### 1. Post Jobs Early in the Week  
Tuesdays see the most new postings ‚Äî both recruiters and job seekers should act accordingly.

### 2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Optimize for Short Lifespan  
Jobs typically stay up only 3 days. Job seekers need alerts; recruiters may consider promoting or reposting mid-week.

### 3. üìç Prioritize NSW & VIC  
These two states offer the majority of roles. Candidates should focus here unless searching for remote roles.

### 4. üìÜ Align Hiring with Seasonal Peaks  
May‚ÄìJune sees a hiring boost ‚Äî great time to apply or post.

### 5. üéì Address the Junior Role Gap  
Only ~2% of jobs target junior talent. Graduates should focus on internships or skill-building, and companies should invest in entry-level roles.

### 6. üîç Target Top Hiring Companies  
Some companies hire at higher volumes ‚Äî great targets for job seekers.

### 7. üì£ Promote Listings When Urgent  
Only 7% of jobs are promoted, so standing out is possible with boosted visibility.
